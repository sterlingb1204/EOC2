    "For **Pandas** questions, you may use standard Python and Pandas commands (joining, merging, math, etc.).  Ensure that the answer is printed in the requested format.  (Note: Your solutions will probably require several lines of Python and Pandas DataFrame manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **SQLite** questions, you should execute as few queries as possible, which may include subqueries and CTEs as needed.  Ensure that the answer is printed in the requested format.  Obviously, several of the questions may have two parts, in which it is appropriate to provide a separate query for each question.  It is also expected for you to use Python as necessary in order to put the results in the proper format, but you should not use Python to do work or computations that SQLite can do for you."
